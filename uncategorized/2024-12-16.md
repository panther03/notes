# integrate the uncached accesses into the cache

this removes the need to worry about an extra bus master for the CPU itself in both instruction and data.

Simply integrate this into the cache as possibly another state. Since it is a cache backed by a state machine there will be no scheduling conflict because only one rule using the bus will be active at a time.
