# bus plan

Since there is only one master in the CPU for now, the interconnect will not need arbitration.
The signals can be OR'd together with the exception of the busy signal which may asserted by a slave when there is no transaction, because otherwise it would be required to read `waitrequest` combinationally. This one should be masked by whatever the current slave device is. 

The master will put an address out on the bus when a request is available on the bluespec side (ready for this is dictated by state == IDLE)
The next cycle, the busy signal is masked by the enable of the address (only need to worry about the bridge slave.)
If it is busy, the transaction is done, and we record the data (in a shift register, in case there is a burst.)

The bridge slave is how we will hook up to the altera components. The interface of the top level module will have this slave interface as well as a UART.


# "base"

base = maximal subset which can be simulated
