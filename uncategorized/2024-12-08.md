# Exception mode logic

All stages are blocked, except for commit. Commit follows the normal logic, except it always squashes the instruction (like if it caused an exception, or was poisoned) instead of sometimes being committed. This will drain all of the instructions from the corresponding execution units. we can add more logic to drain the execution units themselves but we have to be careful about receiving memory responses after we've removed the entries from the queue and such.

# order of operations

1. Memory Unit | done 
2. Branch Unit | done (but need to come back for RFE & HLT)
3. State Module | more or less done
4. Execute
5. Commit
6. Try to stub out everything which remains in the implementation
7. Hook it all together to reveal high-level organization issues (such as declaration order of the stages)
8. Exception handling
