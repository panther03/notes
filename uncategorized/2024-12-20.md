# XR cpu memory barrier vs write memory barrier

"memory barrier" says "This instruction need not be executed in a uniprocessor system", but it includes a write barrier " all prior writes performed by this processor have completed, as have all reads." meanwhile, "write memory barrier" says "One example of this instruction on a uniprocessor system is to ensure that a device has seen a sequence of writes to its registers before asking it to perform a command". Why can memory barrier be skipped?
Will memory barrier also always include a write memory barrier?


# serial state

used for mtcr and halt
my idea is that decode sets this, and in the case of mtcr, upon commit it clears the state (regardless of whether or not it was squashed!!)
except halt never clears it, on purpose. thats because an async exception will switch it to the async state by itself

# mtcr in commit 

to have a precise state, control reg writeback (mtcr) needs to go in commit as well. I seem to have noted this before, but decided to put it in execute anyway. If we don't do this then an exception could happen and the mtcr later in the pipeline would have already taken effect.
